## Typescript Fundamentals

Typescript is "superset" to JS. It is programming language which builds up on JS & it extends JS. It is not Library - Typescript just adds more features to the JS. Most importantly, it adds static typing to JS.

Because JS is dynamically typed, so it does not expects any particular type in data, it does not have by default STATIC typed data. It just takes whatever it gets & then tries to execute this code. **And this dynamic typing causes errors quite often. So, Typescript with static typing could enhance your code & prevent errors.**

-   TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.
-   TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
